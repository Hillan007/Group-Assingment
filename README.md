# Bookstore Database Project

## Project Overview as Explained
This project involves designing and implementing a **MySQL database** for a **bookstore**. The database efficiently stores and manages details about books, authors, customers, orders, and shipping. By completing this project, you'll gain hands-on experience in **database design, SQL programming, and security best practices**.

## Tools and Technologies used
- **MySQL** - For database creation and management.
- **Draw.io** - For visualizing database schema and relationships.
- **Git & GitHub** - For version control.

## Objectives Accomplished in the Project
- Design a **relational database** to store bookstore operations data.
- Create tables with **optimized schema and data types**.
- Implement **foreign keys** and relationships.
- Set up **user roles** for security.
- Query data efficiently for insights.

## Tables Included
The database contains the following key tables:
- **book** - Stores book details.
- **book_author** - Manages book-author relationships.
- **author** - Stores author information.
- **book_language** - Lists book languages.
- **publisher** - Tracks publishers.

- **address** - Stores address details.
- **country** - Lists countries.
- **cust_order** - Manages customer orders.
- **order_line** - Tracks books in an order.
- **shipping_method** - Lists shipping options.
- **order_history** - Logs order updates.
- **order_status** - Lists possible order statuses.
